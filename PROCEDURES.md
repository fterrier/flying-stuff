Circuit: final leg is about 1nm long.

### En-route

- Freda checks every 20 minutes
- HAT checks after each turn
- Write time over turning point
- Think when to contact what station - arrival, en-route, crossings
- Where is the wind coming from?

### Arriving at airfield

- Call for joining
- Understand how to join
- Airfield approach checks
- Set QFE when in sight of airfield
- Climb/descend to circuit height
- Call overhead, downwind, final
- Downwind checks
- Final checks at 300ft
- Landing: Cut speed, round up, look ahead and flare as long as possible (wait for energy)

### Departure

- Vr, then Vx until clear of obstacles, then Vy

### Speeds

Vx: 55kts
Vy: 65kts

### Climbing

- Full power
- Higher nose to reach 65 knots
- Level-off: lower nose, wait for speed to pick up, reduce power

### Descending

- Carb heat
- Power to 1600RPM
- Use attitude to control speed, power for rate of descent
- Level-off: carb heat off, power back, nose up

### Cold weather

### Lights

- Usually no need to use navigation lights, just in clouds and low visibility.
- Landing lights and taxi lights for landing, switch off after vacating runway

Manoeuvres
---

### Stall

- Hasell check
- Carb heat on
- Cut power
- Higher attitude to cut speed (not too much)
- When reaching stall, higher nose until full stall
- Engage recovery
- Nose down, then wings level
- Carb heat off, full power
- (if full flaps) Remove 1 stage of flag
- Recover, check speed
- When positive rate of climb, remove remaining flaps

### Unusual attitude

### Steep turn

- Hasell check
- Start turn
- When reaching 30Â°, add power
- Reduce bank angle if losing altitude

### Slow flight

- 1500 RPM
- Higher attitude to cut speed to 55 knots
- Increase/decrease power to keep altitude

### Short take off

Emergency
---

### PFL

- Adopt best glide speed (65 kts)
- Select field 
  - Wind
  - Obstacles
  - Size
  - Shape
  - Stuff
- Turn to downwind
- Try to restart the engine
  - Fuel valve, Mixture, Throttle, Carb heat, Magnetos, Master switch, Engage starter
- Mayday call
- Secure engine
  - Fuel valve, Mixture, Throttle, Carb heat, Magnetos, Master switch off (flaps!), Open door
- Always check
  - If making field, add flaps
  - If too long, adopt snake or more flaps (nose down to not stall)
  - If too short, pull up (do not remove flaps)

### Control column failure

### Lost procedure
